A superpowered `call_user_func`? Yup! And more.

Wire Genie uses your PSR-11 service container to "magically" provide arguments (dependencies).

Allows you to:
- **invoke any callables**
- **construct any objects**

... with control over the arguments. ðŸ’ª


## Transition to _native attributes_ in PHP 8

>
> ðŸ‘€
>
> This is a transitional version for migrating your code using `v2` annotations to native attributes used in `v3`.\
> Once you are done migrating the annotations, switch to `v3`.
>

Initialize your `Genie` instances with the new `AttributeBasedStrategy`:

```php
new Genie($container, new AttributeBasedStrategy());
```

Update your code to use _native attributes_ instead of the _wire tag_ in `@param` annotations.

| Old code using _wire tags_ | Replace with new code |
|:---------|:-------------|
| `@param $foo [wire:identifier]` | `#[Wire('identifier')]` attribute |
| `@param $foo [wire:App\Services\FooService]` (class-name wire tag) | `#[Wire(App\Services\FooService::class)]` attribute |
| `@param $foo [wire:]` (empty wire tag) | `#[Skip]` attribute |

These attributes need to be applied on the particular parameter:
```php
function(#[Wire('identifier')] $service1, #[Skip] $service2) { ... }
```


## Usage

```php
$container = new Any\Psr11\Container([
    Thing::class => new Thing(),
    MyService::class => new MyService(),
]);

$callable = function (MyService $service, Thing $thing){ ... };

class Something {
    public function __construct(MyService $service, Thing $thing) { ... }
}

$g = new Dakujem\Wire\Genie($container);

// Magic! The dependencies are resolved from the container.
$value  = $g->invoke($callable);
$object = $g->construct(Something::class);
```

That is only the basis, the process is customizable and more powerful.

For each parameter it is possible to:
- override type-hint and wire an explicit dependency (override the type-hint)
- skip wiring (treat as unresolvable)
- override value (bypass the container)

```php
/**
 * Override type-hint(s)
 *
 * @param ServiceInterface $service [wire:App\MyService]
 * @param Thing $service [wire:Some\Thing]
 */
$callable = function (ServiceInterface $service, $thing){ ... };
$value  = $g->invoke($callable);

/**
* Provide arguments for scalar-type, no-type and otherwise unresolvable parameters
 */
$callable = function (string $question, MyService $service, int $answer){ ... };
$g->invoke($callable, 'The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.', 42);

/**
 * Skip wiring for a parameter (provide your own service)
 *
 * @param MyService $service [wire:]  <--- do not wire this parameter
 */
$callable = function (MyService $service){ ... };
$g->invoke($callable, new MyService(...)); // provide your own argument(s)
```


## How it works

There are two primary methods:
```php
Genie::invoke(  callable $target, ...$pool );
Genie::construct( string $target, ...$pool );
```
... where the variadic `$pool` is a list of values that will be used for unresolvable parameters.


> `TagBasedStrategy` / annotations / v2, v1 ðŸ‘‡

The resolution algorithm works like the following. If any step succeeds, the rest is skipped.\
For each parameter...
1. Look for a "wire tag" in the `@param` annotation, resolve its identifier from the container
   - a wire tag with an identifier looks like this: `@param $name [wire:identifier]`,
     where `identifier` may be a full class name or any string
2. If an empty wire tag is present, treat the parameter as unresolvable
   - an empty wire tag looks like this: `@param $name [wire:]`
3. Resolve the type-hinted identifier using the container.
4. When a parameter is unresolvable, try filling in an argument from the pool.
5. Try to skip the parameter. Fails when it has no default value. You need to provide arguments to the pool.


> `AttributeBasedStrategy` / attributes / v3 ðŸ‘‡

The resolution algorithm works like the following. If any step succeeds, the rest is skipped.\
For each parameter...
1. If the parameter name matches a _named argument_ from the pool, use it.
2. If `#[Skip]` hint is present, skip steps 3-6 and treat the parameter as unresolvable.
3. If a `#[Wire(Identifier::class)]` hint (attribute) is present, resolve the hinted identifier using the container.
4. Resolve the type-hinted identifier using the container.
5. If `#[Hot]` hint is present, attempt to create the type-hinted class. Resolve cascading dependencies.
6. If `#[Make(Name::class)]` hint is present, attempt to create the hinted class. Resolve cascading dependencies.
7. When a parameter is unresolvable, try filling in an argument from the pool.
8. If a default parameter value is defined, use it.
9. If the parameter is nullable, use `null`.
10. Fail utterly.


### Hints / attributes

As you can see, the algorithm uses native attributes as hints to control the wiring.

`#[Wire(Identifier::class)]` tells Genie to try to wire the service registered as `Identifier` from the container\
`#[Wire('identifier')]` tells Genie to try to wire service with `'identifier'` identifier from the container\
`#[Hot]` tells Genie to try to create the type-hinted class (works with union types too) \
`#[Make(Service::class, 42, 'argument')]` tells Genie to try to create `Service` class using `42` and `'argument'` as the argument pool for the construction \
`#Skip` tells Genie not to use the container at all

`Hot` and `Make` work recursively,
their constructor dependencies will be resolved from the container or created on the fly too.


## What can it be used for?

- middleware / pipeline _dispatchers_
- asynchronous _job execution_
  - supplying dependencies after a job is deserialized from a queue
- generic _factories_ that create instances with varying dependencies
- _method dependency injection_
  - for controllers, where dependencies are wired at runtime

### A word of caution

Fetching services from the service container on-the-fly might solve
an edge case in certain implementations where dependency injection
boilerplate can not be avoided or reduced in a different way.

It is also the only way to invoke callables with dependencies not known at the time of compilation.

Normally, however, you want to wire your dependencies when building your app's service container.

## Integration

As with many other third-party libraries,
you should consider wrapping code using Wire Genie into a helper class
with methods like the following one:
```php
/**
 * Invokes a callable resolving its type-hinted arguments,
 * filling in the unresolved arguments from the static argument pool.
 * Returns the callable's return value.
 * Also allows to create objects passing in a class name.
 */ 
public function call(/*callable|string*/ $target, ...$pool): mixed
{
    return Genie::employ($this->container)($target, ...$pool);
}
```

This adds a tiny layer for flexibility,
in case you decide to tweak the way you wire dependencies later on.


## Static provisioning

`Genie::provide()` can be used to provision a callable with a fixed list of services without using reflection.

```php
$factory = function( Dependency $dep1, OtherDependency $dep2 ): MyObject {
    return new MyObject($dep1, $dep2);
};
$object = $g->provide( Dependency::class, OtherDependency::class )->invoke($factory);
```


## Limiting access to services

You can limit the services accessible through `Genie` by using a filtering proxy `Limiter`:
```php
$repoGenie = new Genie(
    new Dakujem\Wire\Limiter($container, [
        RepositoryInterface::class,
        // you may whitelist multiple classes or interfaces
    ])
);
```
The proxy uses the `instanceof` type operator
and throws if the requested service does not match at least one of the whitelisted classes or interface names.


## Customization

A custom _strategy_ can be inserted into `Genie`,
and the default `TagBasedStrategy` allows for customization of the resolver mechanism,
thus providing ultimate configurability.


## Compatibility

Framework agnostic. Any PSR-11 container can be used.


## Wonderful lamp

```php
// If we happen to find a magical lamp...
$lamp = new Dakujem\Wire\Lamp($container);

// we can rub it, and a genie might come out!
$genie = $lamp->rub();

// My wish number one is...
$genie->construct(Palace::class);
```


## Flying carpet

We've already got a lamp ðŸª” and a genie ðŸ§ž ... so?
